The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as intended. The inner `div` with the class `inner` is supposed to change its background color on hover of the outer `div` with the class `outer`, but this effect is not taking place.  This is often caused by the specificity of selectors or unintentional blocking of the hover effect.
